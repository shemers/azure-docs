# Migrate databases from SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance using Log Replay Service
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlmi](../includes/appliesto-sqlmi.md)]

This article explains how to manually configure database migration from SQL Server 2008-2019 to SQL Managed Instance using Log Replay Service (LRS). This is a cloud service enabled for Managed Instance based on the SQL Server log shipping technology. LRS should be used in cases when Azure Data Migration Service (DMS) cannot be used, when more control is needed, or when there exists little tolerance for downtime.

## When to use Log Replay Service

In cases that [Azure DMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-managed-instance) cannot be used for migration, LRS cloud service can be used directly with PowerShell, CLI cmdlets, or API, to manually build and orchestrate database migrations to SQL Managed Instance. 

You might want to consider using LRS cloud service in some of the following cases:
- More control is needed for your database migration project
- There exists a little tolerance for downtime on migration cutover
- DMS executable cannot be installed in your environment
- DMS executable does not have file access to database backups
- No access to host OS is available, or no Administrator privileges
- Unable to open networking ports from your environment to Azure

> [!NOTE]
> Recommended automated way to migrate databases from SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance is using Azure DMS. This service is using the same LRS cloud service at the back end with log shipping in NORECOVERY mode. You should consider manually using LRS to orchestrate migrations in cases when Azure DMS does not fully support your scenarios.

## How does it work

Building a custom solution using LRS to migrate databases to the cloud requires several orchestration steps shown in the diagram and outlined in the table below.

The migration consists of making full database backups on SQL Server with CHECKSUM enabled, and copying backup files to Azure Blob Storage. LRS is used to restore backup files from Azure Blob Storage to SQL Managed Instance. Azure Blob Storage is used as an intermediary storage between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance.

LRS will monitor Azure Blob Storage for any new differential, or log backups added after the full backup has been restored, and will automatically restore any new files added. The progress of backup files being restored on SQL Managed Instance can be monitored using the service, and the process can also be aborted if necessary.

LRS does not require a specific backup file naming convention as it scans all files placed on Azure Blob Storage and it constructs the backup chain from reading the file headers only. Databases are in "restoring" state during the migration process, as they are restored in [NORECOVERY](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/restore-statements-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15#comparison-of-recovery-and-norecovery) mode, and cannot be used for reading or writing until the migration process has been fully completed. 

In migrating several databases, backups for each database need to be placed in a separate folder on Azure Blob Storage. LRS needs to be started separately for each database and different paths to separate Azure Blob Storage folders needs to be specified. 

LRS can be started in autocomplete, or continuous mode. When started in autocomplete mode, the migration will complete automatically when the last backup file name specified has been restored. When started in continuous mode, the service will continuously restore any new backup files added, and the migration will complete on the manual cutover only. It is recommended that the manual cutover is executed only after the final log-tail backup has been taken and shown as restored on SQL Managed Instance. The final cutover step will make the database come online and available for read and write use on SQL Managed Instance.

Once LRS is stopped, either automatically on autocomplete, or manually on cutover, the restore process cannot be resumed for a database that was brought online on SQL Managed Instance. To restore additional backup files once the migration was completed through autocomplete, or manually on cutover, the database needs to be deleted and the entire backup chain needs to be restored from scratch by restarting the LRS.

| Operation | Details |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **1. Copy database backups from SQL Server to Azure Blob Storage**. | - Copy full, differential, and log backups from SQL Server to Azure Blob Storage container using [Azcopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10), or [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/). <br />- Use any file names, as LRS does not require a specific file naming convention.<br />- In migrating several databases, a separate folder is required for each database. |
| **2. Start the LRS service in the cloud**. | - Service can be started with a choice of cmdlets: <br /> PowerShell [start-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/start-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay) <br /> CLI [az_sql_midb_log_replay_start cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/midb/log-replay#az_sql_midb_log_replay_start). <br /> - Start LRS separately for each different database pointing to a different backup folder on Azure Blob Storage. <br />- Once started, the service will take backups from the Azure Blob Storage container and start restoring them on SQL Managed Instance.<br /> - In case LRS was started in continuous mode, once all initially uploaded backups are restored, the service will watch for any new files uploaded to the folder and will continuously apply logs based on the LSN chain, until the service is stopped. |
| **2.1. Monitor the operation progress**. | - Progress of the restore operation can be monitored with a choice of or cmdlets: <br /> PowerShell [get-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/get-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay) <br /> CLI [az_sql_midb_log_replay_show cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/midb/log-replay#az_sql_midb_log_replay_show). |
| **2.2. Stop\abort the operation if needed**. | - In case that migration process needs to be aborted, the operation can be stopped with a choice of cmdlets: <br /> PowerShell [stop-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/stop-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay) <br /> CLI [az_sql_midb_log_replay_stop](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/midb/log-replay#az_sql_midb_log_replay_stop) cmdlets. <br /><br />- This will result in deletion of the database being restored on SQL Managed Instance. <br />- Once stopped, LRS cannot be resumed for a database. Migration process needs to be restarted from scratch. |
| **3. Cutover to the cloud when ready**. | - Once all backups have been restored to SQL Managed Instance, complete the cutover by initiating LRS complete operation with a choice of cmdlets: <br />PowerShell [complete-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.sql/complete-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay) <br /> CLI [az_sql_midb_log_replay_complete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/midb/log-replay#az_sql_midb_log_replay_complete) cmdlets. <br /><br />- This will cause LRS service to be stopped and database to come online for read and write use on SQL Managed Instance.<br /> - Repoint the application connection string from SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance. |

## Requirements for getting started

### SQL Server side
- SQL Server 2008-2019
- Full backup of databases (one or multiple files)
- Differential backup (one or multiple files)
- Log backup (not split for transaction log file)
- **CHECKSUM must be enabled** for backups (mandatory)

### Azure side
- PowerShell Az.SQL module version 2.16.0, or above ([install](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Sql/), or use Azure [Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/))
- CLI version 2.19.0, or above ([install](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli))
- Azure Blob Storage container provisioned
- SAS security token with **Read** and **List** only permissions generated for the blob storage container

### Migrating multiple databases
- Backup files for different databases must be placed in separate folders on Azure Blob Storage.
- LRS needs to be started separately for each database pointing to an appropriate folder on Azure Blob Storage.
- LRS can support up to 100 simultaneous restore processes per single SQL Managed Instance.

### Azure RBAC permissions required
Executing LRS through the provided clients requires one of the following Azure roles:
- Subscription Owner role, or
- [Managed Instance Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#sql-managed-instance-contributor) role, or
- Custom role with the following permission:
  - `Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances/databases/*`

## Best practices

The following are highly recommended as best practices:
- Run [Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview) to validate your databases are ready to be migrated to SQL Managed Instance. 
- Split full and differential backups into multiple files, instead of a single file.
- Enable backup compression.
- Use Cloud Shell to execute scripts as it will always be updated to the latest cmdlets released.
- Plan to complete the migration within 47 hours since LRS service has been started. This is a grace period preventing system-managed software patches once LRS has been started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Database being restored using LRS cannot be used until the migration process has been completed. This is because underlying technology is restore in NORECOVERY mode.
> - STANDBY restore mode allowing read-only access to databases during the migration is not supported by LRS due to the version differences between SQL Managed Instance and in-market SQL Servers.
> - Once migration has been completed either through the autocomplete, or on manual cutover, the migration process is finalized as LRS does not support restore resume.

## Steps to execute

### Make backups on the SQL Server

Backups on the SQL Server can be made with either of the following two options:

- Backup to the local disk storage, then upload files to Azure Blob Storage, in case your environment is restrictive of direct backup to Azure Blob Storage.
- Backup directly to Azure Blob Storage with "TO URL" option in T-SQL, in case your environment and security procedures allow you to do so. 

Set databases you wish to migrate to the full recovery mode to allow log backups.

```SQL
-- To permit log backups, before the full database backup, modify the database to use the full recovery model.
USE master
ALTER DATABASE SampleDB
SET RECOVERY FULL
GO
```

To manually make full, diff and log backup of your database on the local storage, use the provided sample T-SQL scripts below. Ensure that CHECKSUM option is enabled as this is a mandatory requirement for LRS.

```SQL
-- Example on how to make full database backup to the local disk
BACKUP DATABASE [SampleDB]
TO DISK='C:\BACKUP\SampleDB_full_14_43.bak',
WITH INIT, COMPRESSION, CHECKSUM
GO

-- Example on how to make differential database backup to the locak disk
BACKUP DATABASE [SampleDB]
TO DISK='C:\BACKUP\SampleDB_diff_14_44.bak',
WITH DIFFERENTIAL, COMPRESSION, CHECKSUM
GO

-- Example on how to make the log backup
BACKUP LOG [SampleDB]
TO DISK='C:\BACKUP\SampleDB_log_14_45.bak',
WITH CHECKSUM
GO
```

Files backed up to the local storage will need to be uploaded to the Azure Blob Storage. In case your corporate policy allows it, alternative way to make backups directly to Azure Blob Storage is documented in the following tutorial: [Use Azure Blob storage service with SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/tutorial-use-azure-blob-storage-service-with-sql-server-2016#1---create-stored-access-policy-and-shared-access-storage). If using this alternative approach, ensure that all backups are made with CHECKSUM option enabled.

### Copy backups from SQL Server to Azure Blob Storage

Some of the following approaches can be utilized to upload backups to the blob storage in migrating databases to managed instance using LRS:
- Using SQL Server native [BACKUP TO URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url) functionality.
- Using [Azcopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10), or [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer) to upload backups to a blob container.
- Using Storage Explorer in Azure portal.

### Create Azure Blob and SAS authentication token

Azure Blob Storage is used as an intermediary storage for backup files between SQL Server and SQL Managed Instance. Follow these steps to create Azure Blob Storage container:

1. [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)
2. [Crete a blob container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) inside the storage account

Once a blob container has been created, generate SAS authentication token with Read and List permissions only following these steps:

1. Access storage account using Azure portal
2. Navigate to Storage Explorer
3. Expand Blob Containers
4. Right click on the blob container
5. Select Get Shared Access Signature
6. Select the token expiry timeframe. Ensure the token is valid for duration of your migration.
	- Note that time zone of the token and your SQL Managed Instance might mismatch. Ensure that SAS token has the appropriate time validity taking time zones into consideration. If possible, set the time zone to an earlier and later time of your planned migration window.
8. Ensure Read and List only permissions are selected
9. Click create
10. Copy the token after the question mark "?" and onwards. The SAS token is typically starting with "sv=2020-10" in the URI for use in your code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Permissions for the SAS token for Azure Blob Storage need to be Read and List only. In case of any other permissions granted for the SAS authentication token, starting LRS service will fail. These security requirements are by design.
> - The token must have the appropriate time validity. Please ensure time zones between the token and managed instance are taken into consideration.
> - Please ensure token is copied starting from "sv=2020-10..." until the end of the string.

### Log in to Azure and select subscription

Use the following PowerShell cmdlet to log in to Azure:

```powershell
Login-AzAccount
```

Select the appropriate subscription where your SQL Managed Instance resides using the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId <subscription ID>
```

## Start the migration

The migration is started by starting the LRS service. The service can be started in autocomplete, or continuous mode. When started in autocomplete mode, the migration will complete automatically when the last backup file specified has been restored. This option requires the start command to specify the filename of the last backup file. When LRS is started in continuous mode, the service will continuously restore any new backup files added, and the migration will complete on the manual cutover only. 

### Start LRS in autocomplete mode

To start LRS service in autocomplete mode, use the following PowerShell, or CLI commands. Specify the last backup file name with -LastBackupName parameter. Upon restoring the last backup file name specified, the service will automatically initiate a cutover.

Start LRS in autocomplete mode - PowerShell example:

```PowerShell
Start-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLogReplay -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" `
	-InstanceName "ManagedInstance01" `
	-Name "ManagedDatabaseName" `
	-Collation "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" `
	-StorageContainerUri "https://test.blob.core.windows.net/testing" `
	-StorageContainerSasToken "sv=2019-02-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2023-12-02T00:09:14Z&st=2019-11-25T16:09:14Z&spr=https&sig=92kAe4QYmXaht%2Fgjocqwerqwer41s%3D" `
	-AutoCompleteRestore `
	-LastBackupName "last_backup.bak"
```

Start LRS in autocomplete mode - CLI example:

```CLI
az sql midb log-replay start -g mygroup --mi myinstance -n mymanageddb -a --last-bn "backup.bak"
	--storage-uri "https://test.blob.core.windows.net/testing"
	--storage-sas "sv=2019-02-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2023-12-02T00:09:14Z&st=2019-11-25T16:09:14Z&spr=https&sig=92kAe4QYmXaht%2Fgjocqwerqwer41s%3D"
```

### Start LRS in continuous mode

Start LRS in continuous mode - PowerShell example:

```PowerShell
Start-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLogReplay -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" `
	-InstanceName "ManagedInstance01" `
	-Name "ManagedDatabaseName" `
	-Collation "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" -StorageContainerUri "https://test.blob.core.windows.net/testing" `
	-StorageContainerSasToken "sv=2019-02-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2023-12-02T00:09:14Z&st=2019-11-25T16:09:14Z&spr=https&sig=92kAe4QYmXaht%2Fgjocqwerqwer41s%3D"
```

Start LRS in continuous mode - CLI example:

```CLI
az sql midb log-replay start -g mygroup --mi myinstance -n mymanageddb
	--storage-uri "https://test.blob.core.windows.net/testing"
	--storage-sas "sv=2019-02-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2023-12-02T00:09:14Z&st=2019-11-25T16:09:14Z&spr=https&sig=92kAe4QYmXaht%2Fgjocqwerqwer41s%3D"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once LRS has been started, any system managed software patches will be halted for the next 47 hours. Upon passing of this window, the next automated software patch will automatically stop the ongoing LRS. In such case, migration cannot be resumed and it needs to be restarted from scratch. 

## Monitor the migration progress

To monitor the migration operation progress, use the following PowerShell command:

```PowerShell
Get-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLogReplay -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" `
	-InstanceName "ManagedInstance01" `
	-Name "ManagedDatabaseName"
```

To monitor the migration operation progress, use the following CLI command:

```CLI
az sql midb log-replay show -g mygroup --mi myinstance -n mymanageddb
```

## Stop the migration

In case you need to stop the migration, use the following cmdlets. Stopping the migration will delete the restoring database on SQL Managed Instance due to which it will not be possible to resume the migration.

To stop\abort the migration process, use the following PowerShell command:

```PowerShell
Stop-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLogReplay -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" `
	-InstanceName "ManagedInstance01" `
	-Name "ManagedDatabaseName"
```

To stop\abort the migration process, use the following CLI command:

```CLI
az sql midb log-replay stop -g mygroup --mi myinstance -n mymanageddb
```

## Complete the migration (continuous mode)

In case LRS is started in continuous mode, once you have ensured that all backups have been restored, initiating the cutover will complete the migration. Upon cutover completion, database will be migrated and ready for read and write access.

To complete the migration process in LRS continuous mode, use the following PowerShell command:

```PowerShell
Complete-AzSqlInstanceDatabaseLogReplay -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" `
-InstanceName "ManagedInstance01" `
-Name "ManagedDatabaseName" `
-LastBackupName "last_backup.bak"
```

To complete the migration process in LRS continuous mode, use the following CLI command:

```CLI
az sql midb log-replay complete -g mygroup --mi myinstance -n mymanageddb --last-backup-name "backup.bak"
```

## Troubleshooting

Once you start the LRS, use the monitoring cmdlets (get-azsqlinstancedatabaselogreplay or az_sql_midb_log_replay_show) to see the status of the operation. If after some time LRS fails to start with an error, please check for some of the most common issues:
- Was the database backup on the SQL Server made using the **CHECKSUM** option?
- Are the permissions on the SAS token **Read** and **List** only for the LRS service?
- Was the SAS token for LRS copied starting after the question mark "?" with content starting similar to this "sv=2020-02-10..."? 
- Is the SAS **token validity** time applicable for the time window of starting and completing the migration? Note that there could be mismatches due to the different **time zones** used for SQL Managed Instance and the SAS token. Try regenerating the SAS token with extending the token validity of the time window before and after the current date.
- Are database name, resource group name, and managed instance name spelled correctly?
- If LRS was started in autocomplete mode, was a valid filename for the last backup file specified?
